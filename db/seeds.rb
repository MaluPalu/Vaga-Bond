# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# t.string “title”
# t.string “description”
# t.bigint “city_id”
# t.datetime “created_at”, null: false
# t.datetime “updated_at”, null: false
# t.index [“city_id”], name: “index_posts_on_city_id”
